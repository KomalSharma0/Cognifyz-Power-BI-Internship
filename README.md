## Overview
This repository contains an interactive dashboard developed in Power BI, analyzing investment preferences based on demographic and behavioral data. The project focuses on uncovering key patterns, motivations, and trends related to various investment avenues.

## Objective
The goal of this internship project was to explore, visualize, and derive insights from investment-related data. The focus was to build a user-friendly, insightful dashboard that could assist stakeholders in understanding investment behaviors and preferences.

## Tasks Completed
1. **Data Exploration and Summary**: Performed initial data analysis to understand key metrics and distributions.
2. **Gender-Based Analysis**: Analyzed investment preferences based on gender.
3. **Savings and Investment Objectives**: Explored correlations of savings objectives (e.g., retirement, healthcare) and investment objectives (e.g., capital appreciation, growth) to investment avenues rating.
4. **Investment Duration and Monitoring Frequency**: Visualized patterns in investment durations and monitoring frequencies.
5. **Reasons for Investment**: Highlighted reasons for choosing different investment types like mutual funds, equity, bonds, and fixed deposits.
6. **Source of Investment Information**: Identified primary sources influencing investment decisions.
7. **Dashboard Development**: Compiled visuals into an interactive, professional dashboard for final insights.

## Key Features of the Dashboard
- **Visualizations**: Includes clustered bar charts, heatmaps, donut charts, line charts, and card visuals.
- **Interactivity**: Filters for gender, factor, purpose, and age to enhance usability.
- **Insights**: Comprehensive insights into investment trends, preferences, and motivations.
